These are explained further by Hewitt (1984).\n\nThe classification should be hierarchical, providing ascending levels of generalisation.\nThe grouping of soils into classes should be based on similarity of measurable soil properties rather than presumed genesis.\nClasses must be designed to allow the greatest number and most precise accessory statements to be made about them consistent with their level in the hierarchy.\nDifferentia should be based on soil properties that can be reproducibly and precisely measured or observed.\nDifferentia should where possible allow field assignment of soils to classes, either directly, or by tested inferences.\nThe nomenclature of higher categories should be based where possible on connotative English words chosen for their acceptability to non-specialists.\nWhere possible, continuity with successful parts of the New Zealand Genetic Classification should be maintained.\nThe soil classification must be valid for the main islands of New Zealand. Classes must be correlated with Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff 1999) to support international extension."

    "section": "2.3 The Soil Individual",
    "text": "2.3 The Soil Individual\nThe soil individual is the fundamental unit of soil which is assigned to classes. Cline (1949) defined an individual as “the smallest natural body that can be defined as a thing complete in itself”.\nSoil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff 1999) regards the polypedon as the soil individual. This is rejected here because, as discussed by Hewitt (1982), it does not fulfil Cline’s (1949) or Johnson’s (1963) requirements for a soil individual.\nIn New Zealand, the soil individual has traditionally been the soil profile. Usually conceived as a two-dimensional section exposed by a soil pit, it is in fact a three-dimensional slice sufficiently thick to sample and examine hand specimens. It should therefore be termed a “soil profile slice”. With the realisation that soils should be examined in successive horizontal sections as well as the vertical profile, there is increasing acceptance that a volume of soil the size of the pedon Soil Survey Staff (1999) represents a better soil individual than the soil profile slice.\nAccordingly, the pedon as defined in Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff 1999) is recommended as the soil individual for the New Zealand Soil Classification. It is understood that assignments are often made from the examination of volumes of soil smaller than a complete pedon, where they are assumed representative of the pedon."

    "text": "2.4 How to assign a soil to Subgroup level\nNormally, a soil pit must be dug of sufficient size to expose the soil horizons to about 1 m depth, or to rock if shallower.\nThe soil horizons are examined and the assignment is then made by following the key, starting with the Key to Orders. The “Diagnostic Horizons and Other Differentiae” section is consulted as necessary to identify diagnostic horizons and other differentia. For some classes, pH or other chemical measurements must be made. These should be performed on samples taken between the specified depths, and bulked from at least four places in the pit. The characteristics of the soil are compared with the key statements of each soil order, starting with Organic Soils and passing down the key to the first soil order that fits them. When a soil order is identified, the chapter concerning that order is consulted and the keys to soil groups and soil subgroups are followed in the same manner to identify the appropriate soil group and subgroup.\nThe name given to a soil assigned to a subgroup is made up of three elements in the sequence: subgroup, group, and order (for example, Nodular Perch-gley Oxidic Soils). Figure 2.1 illustrates the relationships between subgroups and groups in the Oxidic Soils order.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: The hierarchy of the Oxidic Soils as an example of the hierarchical relationships between orders, groups and subgroups. As the diagram suggests, the range of soil properties for each class is related to hierarchical position."

    "text": "2.5 Misclassification\nThe classes are the most important part of the soil classification. The key is merely a means of allocating soils to these classes, and by its nature is imperfect because only a sample of all the possible soils that might potentially be allocated were used in developing the key. Consequently, soils will be found that are not allocated to the appropriate class by the key. This will be apparent when a soil, allocated to a class, does not conform to the concept and accessory statements that can normally be made about that class. Because the key is the servant of the classes, the allocator is justified in placing the soil misfit into a more appropriate class. If this is done, however, it must be registered with the person with responsibility for the national soil classification system, so that appropriate adjustments may be made to the key when the soil classification is next revised. An allocation contrary to the key must also be noted in any records or publication of the allocation."

First, if a soil is judged to be misclassified, and a more appropriate class is not available, then a new subgroup may be justifiable. Second, an existing subgroup may encompass a set of soils with properties that are too wide in range. The old subgroup could be split into two new ones. Splitting may be justified if it will significantly increase the number and precision of accessory statements that can be made about both of the new classes."

Other terms such as “amorphous”, “poorly crystalline” and “non-crystalline”, have been, or are, sometimes used for such minerals. Their chief characteristics are reactive variable-charge surfaces, and a very high specific surface area (several hundreds of m2/g). Allophanic soil material has BOTH\n\nEither\n\nAll of the following (in a fresh sample):\n\nSensitive or strongly sensitive sensitivity class (distinctly greasy or smeary feel except in some sandy soils), and\nVery weak or weak unconfined soil strength class (when moist), and\nNon-sticky or slightly sticky stickiness class, and\nStrong or very strong reactive-aluminium test;\nOR\n\nP retention of 85% or more;\nAND\n\nDry bulk density of the fine-earth fraction (where the volume is determined on a field-moist soil) of less than 0.9 Mg/m3.\n\nLayers meeting the requirements of allophanic soil material may also meet the requirements of vitric soil material.\nAccessory chemical properties relate to variable-charge characteristics, P retention, and high organic-matter contents. Accessory physical properties include high total available water capacity and readily available water capacity, and low penetration resistance. In addition, allophanic soil material undergoes irreversible changes upon drying, for example, in plastic and liquid limits and in apparent particle-size distribution. It should be noted that minerals other than allophane (e.g. ferrihydrite) can give rise to allophanic soil material."

The less stringent limits of the calcareous horizon are needed to distinguish the calcium-carbonate-accumulating horizons in the Semiarid Soils which have developed by weathering of calcium ions from silicate minerals in non-calcareous parent materials.

Exchangeable aluminium, as a percentage of CEC, is usually greater than 25% (and is frequently more than 50% in some part of the horizon).

Small changes in water content from field capacity result in large changes in soil strength and failure. Semi-deformable failure occurs at water contents wetter than field capacity. Very firm or stronger ped strength with brittle failure occurs at soil water matric potentials drier than about 30 kPa. Soil materials lack the characteristic friable failure over a wide range in moisture contents that is exhibited by oxidic horizons; AND\nSoil materials are sticky and very plastic, in comparison to oxidic materials which are only slightly sticky in relation to their clay content; AND\nPeds are larger than 2 mm and have smooth faces with silt-sized aggregates of iron oxide crystallites which give the ped faces a dusty appearance when dry.

Fluvial features are used to differentiate Recent Soils, Raw Soils and parent material classes of soil series that occur on landforms formed through fluvial processes.\nRelevant landforms include floodplains, estuarine surfaces, lacustrine surfaces, aggregating fan surfaces, levees, backplains, bars, channels, deltas, floodplain benches, outwash plains and swamps (all defined by Milne et al. (1991)).\nConfirming soil characteristics include:\n\nA buried A horizon or some other field indication of an irregular change in carbon with depth (such as sedimentary plant-leaf material).\nSedimentary bedding in C horizons, indicating deposition in water (such as scoured surfaces, cross-stratification, sedimentary laminations, current ripples or foreset beds).\nAn unripened horizon with fluid, or very fluid, fluidity class in some layer with an upper surface within 120 cm of the soil surface.\nIn tephric soil materials\n\ndisturbance or overthickening of the regional sequence of tephras;\nrounded or subrounded gravel;\npresence of non-volcanic rock fragments.\n\n\nThe emphasis here on genetic landform criteria is not consistent with the principle that soils should be classified on the basis of similarity of measurable soil properties rather than presumed genesis (see Introduction). Measurable soil properties that will group together the required soils have not been recognised. The confirmatory soil properties, however, will aid class assignment decisions in many cases."

It is likely that the iron has been precipitated from iron-rich groundwater moving laterally. In Taranaki (Childs, Palmer, and Ross 1990), the pans are porous and some appear to have formed as iron-oxide rhizomorphs, which have been progressively infilled and welded together by further precipitations of iron oxide. In these pans the mineralogy is dominated by varying proportions of goethite and ferrihydrite.\nIronstone-pans are not usually associated with eluvial horizons and do not occur in Podzols. They differ from ortstein-pans and placic horizons which are often associated with eluvial horizons in Podzols or Brown Soils, and which have high organic carbon levels. Ironstone pans meet the requirements of the material below a petroferric contact of Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff 1999).\nThe pans are a barrier to plant roots. Heavy machinery is required to break them up for the installation of drains. The permeability of the pans is likely to be slow."

Cracks or joints occur at horizontal intervals of more than 100 mm. These materials occur on the ignimbrites, Otago schists, basalt flows of the Dunedin complex, and Fiordland granites. They often cause drainage impedance.\nShattered-lithic materials are similar except that joints or cracks may occur at intervals of less than 100 mm. Shattered-lithic materials differ from fragmental or skeletal materials in which there is no continuity of geological structure between adjacent rock fragments, and rock fragment faces do not accommodate one another.

    "section": "5.4 Accessory Properties of the Order",
    "text": "5.4 Accessory Properties of the Order\n\nShort-range-order minerals. The soil matrix as well as pore surfaces are dominated by the clay minerals allophane, imogolite and ferrihydrite, and/or aluminium-humus complexes. The soil materials have very high specific surface area. Measured clay contents generally range from 10 to 25% though particle-size measurement is difficult because of aggregation and the “true” or primary clay contents may often be considerably higher. P retention is high or very high.\nLow bases. Sum of bases are low to very low and range from less than 1 to 10 cmol/100 g in subsoils and unfertilised topsoils.\nVolcanic or greywacke parent materials. Predominantly in andesitic, rhyolitic or mixed tephra, they also occur in soil materials from sandstone (greywacke) of humid uplands and high country and basalt scoria or pumice.\nRapidly weatherable minerals. Volcanic glass and feldspar dominate the sand fractions of soils in igneous parent materials, and are the primary source of the short-range-order minerals. Feldspars are most likely the primary source in non-igneous parent materials. Typically they have an Amorphic mineralogy class.\nRapid permeability and high water retention. The macroporosity is very high and rapid drainage occurs at low soil moisture tensions. Water contents at 1500 kPa soil moisture tension are very high.\nWell drained. Although poorly, imperfectly and moderately well drained soils occur, well drained soils are predominant.\nGood rooting medium. Bulk density is very low and there is little resistance to root extension. In many soils the potential rooting depth is very deep.\nActive soil fauna. Microbial biomass is generally high.\nStable topsoils. Soils resist puddling under the impact of machinery or grazing animals in wet weather. The water content at field capacity is less than the plastic limit. Topsoil and subsoil horizons are friable, and organic/mineral complexes are stable. Carbon contents are medium to high. Exposed topsoil may be subject to wind erosion.\nHigh shrinkage potential. Soil materials have high potential to shrink on drying. Rewetting may not achieve the original volume.\nSlight to insignificant erosion under pasture. Generally the erosion potential is low, except on steep slopes or exposed sites and under cultivation on rolling slopes.\nSensitive. A pronounced loss of strength occurs on disturbance.\nLimited fertility. There are usually requirements for phosphorus, potassium and magnesium on dairy farms. There are no significant trace element deficiencies although cobalt is marginal in more strongly leached Allophanic Soils. Pasture may respond to lime where pH is less than 5.3. Sulphate reserves are held in B horizons. P retention and phosphate fixation are high in topsoils.\nMoist climate. Precipitation exceeds 1000 mm and soil moisture deficits are either absent or occur for only short periods."

Anthropic Soils occur in land surfaces that are made by people. Their classification reflects the way in which they were made and the kinds of materials used.\nNote that soils that have been drastically disturbed but have been restored to the extent that they will meet the requirements of orders other than Recent Soils or Raw Soils, will not be assigned to Anthropic Soils. For this reason Anthropic soils are placed late in the Key to Orders but before Recent Soils and Raw Soils."

The soil is brunified (i.e. iron and aluminium oxides form coatings around phyllosilicate clay particles and form bridges between these particles and humus). P retention is moderate to very high.\nLow to moderate base saturation. Base saturation values in subsoils are usually less than 50%, and KCl-extractable aluminium levels are usually more than 1.5 cmol(+)/kg except where clay contents are relatively low.\nParent materials are mostly weakly weathered. Mafic Brown Soils are derived from weakly weathered intermediate or basic igneous rocks (e.g. phonolite and basalt). Other groups are derived dominantly from acid quartzo-feldspathic sedimentary rocks (schist and greywacke) or acid igneous rocks (e.g. rhyolites and granites).The alteration status of gravel or hard rock substrates is usually fresh to moderately weathered and occasionally highly weathered.\nMica/illite and vermiculite are common clay minerals. Profiles tend to be mineralogically uniform with depth. Brown soils cover a wide range of mineralogy classes. Mixed, Illitic, Vermiculitic and Clay-mineralic (involving vermiculite and mica-vermiculite) are common. Some Allophanic Brown Soils have an Amorphic mineralogy class.\nGood Drainage. No poorly drained or very poorly drained soils are included. Macroporosity is generally moderate (10–14%) except in subsurface horizons of Firm Brown Soils.\nBiologically active. Except in soils that are limited by coldness or acidity, cast spheroidal peds are common in topsoils and C/N ratios are moderate to low. The roots of native plants penetrate deeply.\nRelatively stable topsoils. Aggregates are not readily dispersed.\nMoist climate or low available-water capacity. Most soils occur in areas with mean annual precipitation more than 1000 mm. Others have low available-water capacity (usually less than 75 mm as in some Stony Brown Soils and Sandy Brown Soils), or are in sites with low evapotranspiration."

Redox segregations of iron and manganese oxides, however, are usually present elsewhere in the soil and may occupy large volumes.\nCommonly formed in alluvial or colluvial parent materials. Soils most frequently occur in relatively low parts of the landscape, in hollows or associated with flushes.\nWide range of clay minerals. The clay mineralogy commonly reflects the mineralogy of the ungleyed material from which the soils are derived. Gley Soils cover a wide range of mineralogy classes with Mixed, Illitic, and Smectitic being the most common.\nPoorly or very poorly drained. Topsoils have relatively high levels of organic matter and some are peaty. Subsurface horizons to depth are dominantly grey or bluish grey in colour with strong brown to dark brown redox segregations.\nHigh groundwater-tables. Most are affected by high groundwater-tables, at least throughout winter months. Soils with slowly permeable layers may also be subject to perching.\nShallow potential rooting depth. Potential rooting depth is limited by poor aeration. Even after drainage, root extension may be limited in some horizons.\nRelatively high bulk densities. Bulk densities are likely to be higher than in well drained soils in similar soil materials.\nLimited trafficability. Trafficability is limited in most soils when wet and pugging damage by stock is likely.\nResponse to drainage. Crops, not adapted to wetness, respond well to drainage.\nMinimal erosion. Flooding or ponding of water is likely on low-lying sites, especially on floodplains. Deposition of fresh sediment is possible in these sites.\nNitrogen requirement. Nitrogen requirements are likely to be higher than for associated well drained soils."

The soil fabric comprises polyhedral peds with strength characteristics which change rapidly with water content. Consistence is sticky and plastic. The presence of vermiculite gives these soils a moderate buffering capacity. The soils lack the weak strength, friable failure, low plasticity, and low-activity-clay properties which either define or are accessory to Oxidic Soils. Clay coatings where they occur are thin."

The extension of plant roots in subsoils is commonly limited by either high penetration resistance, wetness or aluminium toxicity.\nLimited workability when wet. Workability and trafficability is constrained by stickiness and plasticity after heavy rainfall, particularly in contrast to Oxidic Soils.\nLow phosphorus status.

Melanic Soils usually have a Smectitic, Illitic or Kandic mineralogy class.\nHigh base saturations. Base saturations are usually more than 50%, and KCl-extractable aluminium values are usually very low.\nStable structure. Structural stability of topsoils is high with relatively large amounts of organic carbon intimately associated with clay minerals. The soils are likely to have relatively high resistance to structural damage under heavy cropping unless organic matter is reduced significantly. The porosity is stabilised by divalent ion/organic matter/ clay complexes.\nHigh shrink/swell. The soil materials are sticky and plastic. They are expected to have significant shrink/swell potential, expressed in high coefficient of linear expandibility values. This is reflected in strong polyhedral, blocky or prismatic pedality. Pretentions are moderate to high.\nFertile. Exchangeable calcium and magnesium values are high, particularly at the base of profile.\nParent materials. The soils are derived from calcareous rocks or from mafic or ultramafic rocks (e.g. basalt or peridotite).\nDeep rooting. Except for shallow soils on rock or soils affected by high water-tables, potential rooting depths are relatively large.\nBiologically active. Carbon/nitrogen ratios are low (except in areas with very high precipitation)."

The soils are weakly buffered. Some subhorizons have a net positive charge. Oxidic Soils usually have the following mineralogy classes: Kandic, Ferritic or Aluminitic.\nHigh phosphate retention. P-retention ranges from 60 to 90%. High sulphate adsorption occurs in B horizons.\nParent materials. The soils are derived from andesites, dolerites and basalts of Tertiary to Upper Cretaceous age.\nLimited root depth. The extension of plant roots is limited by high dry bulk density and high penetration resistance, particularly in well drained soils. Plant root depths are shallow to medium.\nModerate or rapid infiltration. Hydraulic conductivity of surface horizons and upper B horizons is moderate or faster, giving excellent trafficability and workability immediately after rain.\nSlow permeability. Hydraulic conductivity decreases to slow or marginally slow values with depth, such that perching of water occurs within the root zone after high intensity rainfalls. The duration of wetness varies from 1 to 2 days in well drained soils to 4 days or more in poorly drained soils.\nSoil water deficit. Deficits occur in summer and are exacerbated by low readily available water capacities and shallow rooting depths.\nHigh clay contents. Clay content ranges from 50 to 90%.\nWell developed structure.

Extractable iron and aluminium values are low or moderate with a significant proportion of secondary iron oxides occurring in redox segregations.\nHigh base status. Base saturation values in subsoils are high (more than 50%) except in perch-gleyed soils, where values may be lower in horizons overlying fragipans.\nSiliceous parent materials. Parent materials are predominantly loess or sediments derived from quartzo-feldspathic rocks (schist or greywacke).\nMica/illite clay minerals. Pallic Soils usually belong either to the Illitic or to a Clay-mineralic mineralogy class.\nSlow permeability. Subsurface horizons have restricted permeability, particularly in soils with fragipans or duripans in which the permeability is very slow.\nPerched water-tables. Soils that are poorly or moderately well drained have water-tables perched on slowly permeable layers.\nLimited root depth. Potential rooting depth in most soils is limited by a subsurface horizon of high bulk density at shallow depths or by brittle silty cappings on stones.\nStrongly worm-mixed. Topsoils generally have a significant proportion of worm casts and a distinct worm-mixed horizon occurs in the transition from A to B horizons. Topsoil worm activity is greatly reduced during summer periods of soil moisture deficit.\nHigh slaking and dispersion potential. Soil material, particularly in B horizons, is strongly dispersive and will readily slake. Topsoil structures may break down under prolonged impact by heavy machinery or by continuous tillage.\nDroughty summers, moist winters. Precipitation ranges from about 500 to 1000 mm per year. A spring surplus of soil water is common but the annual surplus is less than about 200 mm. The average annual deficit is approximately 90–200 mm/year.\nPhosphorus status. A high proportion of the inorganic phosphorus is non-occluded and a relatively high proportion of total phosphorus is in an organic form.\nSulphur status. Levels of extractable sulphate are low."

In B horizons they are coated, and in some soils cemented, by short-range-order minerals and/or organic matter.\nLow base saturation. Base saturations are very low and the soils are extremely acid in A and E horizons. KCl-extractable-aluminium levels are high, and aluminium in soil solution may be toxic to some plants.\nParent materials. The soils occur mainly in materials from silica-rich rocks such as granite, greywacke, schist or rhyolite.\nMineralogically differentiated. Mica-smectite or smectite often occur in A and E horizons, and hydroxy-coated or interlayered minerals or allophane often occur in the B horizon. In some Northland soils, silica is dominant in B horizons. Podzols cover a wide range of mineralogy classes.\nLimited rooting depth. The rooting depth is limited for many introduced plants by low pH or aluminium toxicity, or by pans which often cause problems of wetness.\nLow biological activity. Low levels of faunal activity occur with a low rate of mineralisation. Carbon/nitrogen ratios are very high. The accumulation of weakly decomposed humus and minimal incorporation of humus into the upper mineral soil results in a mor-like humus form.\nMor-forming vegetation. The soils have been associated with vegetation producing an acid litter of low nutrient content.\nInfertile. The soils have very low natural fertility with high nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and lime requirements.\nWet climate. The soils occur mainly in areas with a precipitation of 1400 mm or more and unless sandy, are likely to have a soil water surplus for a considerable part of the year."

The clay minerals are dominantly allophane and imogolite and occur as coatings around glass or pumice particles. Phosphate retention is moderate or high. Most Pumice Soils belong to the Glassy or Amorphic mineralogy classes.\nLow soil strengths. Soil strength is weak or very weak. The soils are apedal earthy or single-grain or extremely fine spheroidal, except in welded layers which are massive and may have higher strength.\nPumice is not strongly altered. The alteration status of pumice gravel ranges from fresh to moderately weathered. Glass is predominant in sand fractions.\nDeep rooting. The soils provide a deep rooting medium except in welded flow tephras.\nVery high macroporosity. The macroporosity enables rapid drainage at low soil-water tensions. The available water content is high.\nSensitive. The soils are non-plastic and are sensitive, with low strength when disturbed.\nResistant to pugging. Water contents at field capacity are less than the plastic limit. Pumice Soils may, however, be susceptible to compaction on loading, with consequent reduced infiltration.\nLow reserves of major nutrient elements. Sulphur, potassium, nitrogen, phosphorus and magnesium are usually required for agricultural or horticultural crops. Reserve potassium (Kc) is low and exchangeable magnesium is very low, particularly in subsoils.\nTrace elements are likely to be deficient. Trace elements that are possibly deficient include cobalt, copper, molybdenum, boron, iodine and selenium.\nErosive. The potential for erosion by water is high."

P retention levels are also very low (usually less than 15%).\nHigh base status. Base saturation values in subsoils are high and rise to 100% at the base of the solum.\nParent materials. The soils occur in materials from non-calcareous quartzo-feldspathic schist and indurated sandstone (greywacke).\nIllitic clay mineralogy. Mica/illite clay minerals predominate with trace primary chlorite and kaolinite. Semiarid Soils almost always have an Illitic mineralogy class unless they have a clay content of less than 10% and fall into the Mixed class.\nPermeability. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is slow in soils with argillic or cutanic horizons, and in some other silty or fine sandy soils. Infiltration may be reduced by traffic or treading when soils are saturated by irrigation water.\nDrainage. No poorly or very poorly drained soils are included.\nAvailable water capacity. Available water capacity is limited in most subsoils.\nLow biological activity. In the natural state, biological activity is limited by droughtiness.\nHigh slaking and dispersion potential. Soil materials are strongly dispersive and will readily slake.\nErosive. The soils are susceptible to wind and fluvial erosion.\nWeakly buffered. The soils are weakly buffered because of low CEC and anion adsorption capacity. They are consequently very sensitive to management, showing rapid changes in response to fertilisation, irrigation and cultivation.\nSoluble salts. Soluble salts are present in many soils and land management must consider the risk of salinisation.\nHigh sodium. Many soils, particularly those with argillic horizons have high percentage sodium saturation of the exchange complex.\nClimate. Precipitation ranges from about 350 to 500 mm per year, with zero water surplus and a spring soil moisture deficit."

They are developed in clayey weathering products of siliceous sediments or acid igneous rocks and usually contain mixtures of clay minerals including kaolinite, halloysite, aluminium-interlayered vermiculite and smectite. A few are developed in the weathering products of limestones and greensands. They have low potassium, magnesium and phosphorus reserves and small concentrations of weatherable minerals. E horizons or other features such as skeletans in the upper parts of the Bt horizon are indicative of clay destruction/removal processes. Argillic horizons are usually present."

KCl-extractable aluminium levels of more than 1 cmol(+)/kg are usual in B horizons, and indicate toxic aluminium which may inhibit root function and may contribute to shallow rooting habits in aluminium-sensitive plants.\nClayey subsoils. CEC values are medium to high. Ultic Soils cover a wide range of mineralogy classes, Kandic and Smectitic being the most common.\nLow Kc and Mgr. Low concentrations of reserve magnesium and potassium resulting from strong weathering.\nStrongly weathered with low nutrient reserves. Low levels of 0.5M H2SO4- extractable phosphorus (usually less than 3 mg/100 g) and total phosphorus (usually less than 20 mg/100 g) are characteristic. The former reflects low solubility and/or a low level of inorganic phosphorus reserves. Phosphorus supply from inorganic sources under zero phosphorus input grassland farming is negligible after about 2 years. Strong weathering is indicated by low ratio of 0.5M H2SO4--extractable phosphorus to inorganic phosphorus, usually 0.25 or less.\nSlow permeability. A slowly permeable layer occurs in clayey profiles. The majority of soils are imperfectly to poorly drained, few are well-drained. Soil water movement is mainly along planar voids.\nSusceptibility to livestock treading damage. Clayey or low strength silty surface horizons are susceptible to treading damage or compaction during wet periods.\nDispersible surface horizons. Surface horizons, especially silty ones, are dispersible according to the test of McQueen (1981), and are prone to erosion where the surface cover has been removed. Although P retention is usually moderate or high in B horizons, it may be low in A and E horizons consistent with low contents of secondary iron oxides."

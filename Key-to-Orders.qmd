# Key to Soil Orders {#sec-key}

In the keys to orders, groups or subgroups, any surface mantle of new material, e.g. fresh alluvium, that is less than 30 cm thick, is not considered as part of the soil for assignment to orders, groups or subgroups, except in the [Recent Soils](Recents.qmd#sec-ord-R) or [Raw Soils](Raws.qmd#sec-ord-W), or [Sulphuric Gley](Gleys.qmd#sec-key-GU) or [Recent Gley](Gleys.qmd#sec-key-GR) groups of the [Gley Soils](Gleys.qmd#sec-ord-G). A surface mantle of new material can be recognised because it will not meet the requirements of the key for any order or group except those specified above.

**If any soil has an overthickened A horizon with its base at 45 cm or more from the mineral soil surface and is not mottled within 30 cm of the mineral surface, the key should be entered directly at [Recent Soils](#sec-R).**

## [**O** - Organic Soils](Organics.qmd#sec-ord-O) {#sec-O}

Soils that have horizons that consist of [organic soil material](Diagnostics.qmd#sec-diag-org) (including soils that have skeletal layers in which the matrix of the gravel consists of [organic soil material](Diagnostics.qmd#sec-diag-org)) that within 60 cm of the soil surface are **EITHER**

1.  30 cm or more thick (cumulative) and are entirely formed from peat or other organic soil materials that have accumulated under wet conditions (they are saturated with water for at least 30 consecutive days in most years, or have been artificially drained) (O horizons), **OR**
2.  40 cm or more thick and are formed from partly decomposed or well decomposed litter (F and H horizons).

## [**G** - Gley Soils](Gleys.qmd#sec-ord-G) {#sec-G}

Other soils that have **EITHER**

1.  a [gley profile form](Diagnostics.qmd#sec-diag-gleypf) in which the [reductimorphic horizon](Diagnostics.qmd#sec-diag-redmh) (but not including soils with pedal horizons in which the defined greyish colours occur on ped faces but not in 50% or more of the matrix) meets all of the following:
    (a) it has a lower boundary 90 cm or more from the mineral soil surface, or to a [lithic](Diagnostics.qmd#sec-diag-lithc) or [paralithic contact](Diagnostics.qmd#sec-diag-plith) if shallower, or rests upon a permeable sandy-skeletal layer with a base that extends to 90 cm or more from the mineral soil surface, or to the base of the B horizon, ***and***
    (b) there is no underlying [fragipan](Diagnostics.qmd#sec-diag-fpan) with matrix of chroma 3 or more dominant, [duripan](Diagnostics.qmd#sec-diag-dpan) or underlying [podzolic-B horizon](Diagnostics.qmd#sec-diag-podzb), ***and***

2.  a B horizon which in the major part:
    (a) is pedal with clay or humus coatings present on 10% or more ped faces, ***and***
    (b) has slightly firm or stronger soil strength when moist unless the texture is sandy loam or sandy clay loam, ***and***
    (c) has less silt than clay, unless there are weathered stones, ***and***

[^key-to-orders-1]: "the major part" means that the requirement must be met over more than half the specified thickness (in this case from the base of the A horizon to 60 cm from the mineral soil surface). Analyses or estimates should be used from subhorizons that subdivide the thickness, or if the subhorizons are not recognised, then from subsamples of the relevant horizons.
